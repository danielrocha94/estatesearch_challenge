# README

This developer challenge focused on giving users a good experience, it gives the user the ability to create its own account and see their own questions and other user's questions as well

It is simulated that any question can be paid for by any user. 

It uses Devise for authentication, please create an account to log in.

This approach uses a simple, friendly, minimalistic and intuitive UI so that users will have no trouble working with it.

Due to time restraints, many functionalities were limited and much is still left undone.

But I hope this project gives a good idea of the general intention on building this application.


This App is using tailwind, and psql. In order to run locally, it is only needed to run the command: ./bin/dev in the project's root folder
